# **_Work experience_**

My first job-place was build organisation in Bolshaya Berestovitsa, Grodno region. I controlled build process but this job don't cared for my soul.

> Next step - TV

think I and go to Minsk. In 2009 I entered to the Institute of Journalism. In 2010 started my TV-career. It was sport direction of STV channel. I worked as a reporter for four years. In 2014 I was invited to the TV-channel "Belarus-1". My functions have expended:

- reporter
- TV-presenter
- sports commentator

---

# **_My plans_**

"Belarus-1" is a part of media holding Belteleradiocompany (biggest TV-media in Belarus). This structure is controled by governments.
After the presidential election, my conscience said:

> You can't work here.

So it was decided to try IT.
